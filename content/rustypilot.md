I took two breaks in my flying career, and missed out on nearly 20 years of flying fun.  I'm beyond glad that I got back in the air, and re-learning how to fly was instructive to the types of challenges that pilots have after long breaks.

The first time I got back into the cockpit, it was a strange feeling.  Everything was familiar, but I couldn't make the plane do what I once could.  Perhaps like dancing with two left feet while chewing bubblegum?

I'd love to sit down and develop a plan to get you back into the cockpit.  We can slowly address any gaps in your knowledge while we build your proficiency in the air.  I also advocate for completing a phase or two of the FAA Wings Program, which may save you money on your insurance.

If you prefer to start with some online training, I can connect you with several excellent online learning programs (and save you some money, too).

My goal is to build you a custom-tailored program, based on your needs, experience, and mission, so that we can work to get you back into the air as quickly as possible.  Please reach out to me so that we can make it happen!
