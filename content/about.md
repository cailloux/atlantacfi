Hi! I'm Tim, a passionate aviation enthusiast and flight instructor who has been sharing my joy for flying with friends for over 20 years. After some time away from the cockpit, I became a CFI so that I can share my love of aviation and my passion for teaching. I am dedicated to helping my students achieve their goals and reach new heights in their flying careers.

Born and raised in Connecticut, Europe, amd Africa, my love for aviation was ignited at a young age. I regularly traveled with my family, and one of my earliest memories is riding in the cockpit of a Boeing 747 for takeoff. After earning my pilot's license through the Yellow Jacket Flying Club at Georgia Tech, I decided to share my love of aviation with others by becoming a flight instructor. I earned my Commercial and Certified Flight Instructor ratings with the club, as well.

As a flight instructor, I am committed to safety and excellence, and I believe that a strong foundation of knowledge and skill is the key to success in aviation. Whether we're reviewing how to navigate complex airspace, perfecting landing techniques, or preparing for a checkride, I am always focused on helping my students become the best pilots they can be.

When I'm not in the air, I share my passion for aviation with others through writing and speaking engagements. I am an active member of the aviation community and am always eager to connect with fellow pilots and aviation enthusiasts.

If you're ready to take your flying skills to the next level, I'd love to talk. I want to help you achieve your aviation dreams and soar to new heights.
