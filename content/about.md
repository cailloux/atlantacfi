Hi! I'm Tim, a pilot and flight instructor with over 25 years of aviation experience. I began flying with the Yellow Jacket Flying Club at Georgia Tech and continued with the YJFC to become a flight instructor. I now fly and instruct for recreation, and love to teach "practical IFR," which combines piloting and planning skills, so that pilots have the confidence to take longer trips to new and interesting destinations.

As a flight instructor, I am committed to safety and learning, and I believe that a strong foundation of knowledge and skill is the key to success in aviation. I believe advancement comes through understanding the basics. Learning to fly is also a lot of fun, and I look for opportunities to expand students' experience beyond "the basics." I love to take new pilots to a grass runway for "soft field" practice or experience the true darkness of flying at night to develop comfort in different scenarios.

When I'm not in the air, I share my passion for aviation with others. I am an FAA Safety Team Rep and conduct regular webinars and seminars to improve General Aviation safety.

If you're ready to take your flying skills to the next level, I'd love to talk. I want to help you achieve your aviation dreams and soar to new heights.
