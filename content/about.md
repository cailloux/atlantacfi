Hi! I'm Tim, a passionate aviation enthusiast and flight instructor who has been sharing my joy for flying with friends for over 25 years. I am dedicated to helping my students achieve their goals and reach new heights in their flying careers.

After earning my pilot's license through the Yellow Jacket Flying Club at Georgia Tech, I decided to share my love of aviation with others by becoming a flight instructor and enjoy teaching students at every level. I particularly love teaching "practical IFR," which combines piloting and planning skills, with a heavy dose of real-world application.

As a flight instructor, I am committed to safety and excellence, and I believe that a strong foundation of knowledge and skill is the key to success in aviation. Whether we're reviewing how to navigate complex airspace, perfecting landing techniques, or preparing for a checkride, I am always focused on helping my students become the best pilots they can be.

When I'm not in the air, I share my passion for aviation with others through writing and speaking engagements. I am an FAA Safety Team Rep and conduct regular webinars and seminars to improve General Aviation safety.

If you're ready to take your flying skills to the next level, I'd love to talk. I want to help you achieve your aviation dreams and soar to new heights.
