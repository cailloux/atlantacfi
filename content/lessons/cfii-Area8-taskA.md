### Non-Precision Instrument Approach

1. Exhibits instructional knowledge of the elements of a nonprecision instrument approach by describing⎯
   1. selection of the appropriate instrument approach procedure chart. 
   2. pertinent information on the selected instrument approach chart. 
   3. radio communications with ATC and compliance with ATC clearances, instructions, and procedures. 
   4. appropriate aircraft configuration, airspeed, and checklist items. 
   5. selection, tuning, identification, and determination of operational status of ground and aircraft navigation equipment. 
   6. adjustments applied to the published MDA and visibility criteria for the aircraft approach category. 
   7. maintenance of altitude, airspeed, and track, where applicable. 
   8. establishment and maintenance of an appropriate rate of descent during the final approach segment. 
   9. factors that should be considered in determining whether: 
      1.  the approach should be continued straight-in to a landing; 
      2.  a circling approach to a landing should be made; or 
      3.  a missed approach should be performed. 
2. Exhibits instructional knowledge of common errors related to a nonprecision instrument approach by describing⎯
   1. failure to have essential knowledge of the information on the instrument approach chart. 
   2. incorrect communications procedures or noncompliance with ATC clearances or instructions. 
   3. failure to accomplish checklist items. 
   4. faulty basic instrument flying technique. 
   5. inappropriate descent below the MDA. 
3. Demonstrates and simultaneously explains a nonprecision instrument approach from an instructional standpoint. 
4. Analyzes and corrects simulated common errors related to a nonprecision instrument approach. 
5. Exhibits instructional knowledge on the uses of the MFD and other graphical navigational displays, if installed, to monitor position, track, wind drift, and other parameters to maintain desired flightpath.
