### Constant Airspeed Climbs and Descents

1. Exhibits instructional knowledge of constant airspeed climbs and descents by describing⎯
   1. procedure using full panel and partial panel for an entry into a straight climb or climbing turn, from either cruising or climbing airspeed. 
   2. a stabilized straight climb or climbing turn. 
   3. a level-off from a straight climb or climbing turn, at either cruising or climbing airspeed. 
   4. procedure using full panel and partial panel for an entry into a straight descent or descending turn from either cruising or descending airspeed. 
   5. a stabilized straight descent or descending turn. 
   6. a level-off from a straight descent or descending turn, at either cruising or descending airspeed. 
2. Exhibits instructional knowledge of common errors related to constant airspeed climbs and descents by describing⎯
   1. failure to use a proper power setting and pitch attitude. 
   2. improper correction of vertical rate, airspeed, heading, or rate-of-turn errors. 
   3. uncoordinated use of controls. 
   4. improper trim control. 
3. Demonstrates and simultaneously explains a constant airspeed climb and a constant airspeed descent from an instructional standpoint. 
4. Analyzes and corrects simulated common errors related to constant airspeed climbs and descents.
