It's great to say hi.  I'm looking forward to working with you.

### First Lesson Checklist:
Everything in aviaiton has a checklist.  So should your first lesson!
1. Photo ID (Drivers License, etc.)
2. TSA Documentation (Passport, etc.)
3. Written Exam Score Report, if you have one
4. Any flight training gear you already have (don't go buying anything for the first lesson)
5. Logbook, if you have one

### My Availability:
I'm usually available on Monday and Thursday afternoons/evenings and I have pretty good weekend availability, as well.  We can work on "big picture" scheduling to make sure our schedules overlap, and then we can start getting lessons scheduled on the calendar.  I'd like to get scheduled with you soon so that we can start your flight instruction.  With some advanced planning, I should be able to accommodate your schedule.

Availability isn't usually a problem if we schedule in advance, so I'm happy to work with you to get our flights scheduled.  I usually suggest scheduling 2-3 flights per week because weather will pose a problem to some of those flights.

### Our First Meeting:
Please bring your passport (and/or other TSA documentation) to our first meeting.  I need to verify this before we can begin flight instruction.  We'll also tackle some of the other details (below).

### Logbook:
[Aircraft Spruce](https://www.aircraftspruce.com/categories/pilot_supplies/ps/menus/ps/logbooks_0pilot.html) is next to the Peachtree City Airport, so it doesn't get much easier than buying from them.  You can buy an aviation logbook online from all the usual places.  Almost any logbook will do, including electronic logbooks.  In addition to a paper logbook, I also use [MyFlightBook](https://www.myflightbook.com/) and [Foreflight](https://www.foreflight.com).  We'll need this for the first meeting to record your TSA Endorsement.

### Atlanta Flying Club Dues (FFC):
The Atlanta Flying Club dues and membership structure is on [their website](https://www.atlantaflyingclub.com/membership).

### Scheduling Flights:
Aircraft are booked and scheduled in [Flight Circle](https://www.flightcircle.com/).  As you start to schedule flights, we'll stay in contact so that I can confirm I'm available.  I also want to make sure that you book far enough into the future to get the schedule that you want to maintain your proficiency and build new skills.

### Equipment:
Here's the list of equipment that is useful to get and start collecting.  You won't need any of this for your first lesson, but I wanted to give you some guidance on what you'll end up with:
* Flight Bag (a small duffel or backpack will work fine, no need to get something fancy to start with)
* Paper or Digital Logbook (see above section, Logbooks)
* E6B Flight Computer (manual, and there are also apps)
* Plotter (for aviation charts)
* Current Sectional Chart (aviation "map")
* Kneeboard
* Headset
* Current FAR/AIM (digital or paper)
* Pilot Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge (digital or paper)

### Electronic Flight Bag:
An EFB is a very popular tool in aviation.  It combines electronic version of charts with a moving map, flight planning, and weight-and-balance calculators.  ForeFlight is the most popular, with Garmin Pilot probably holding the second place.  There's no need to rush out and buy an iPad and an app subscription.  We'll do a fair bit of flying without using and EFB.  Using one will make the early learning harder, and transitioning to an EFB when you're a proficient pilot is incredibly simple.

### FAA Student Pilot Certificate:
Good news!  The FAA already wants to give you a license.  It's your Student Pilot Certificate.  You'll need this before you can take your first solo flight, so we can handle this before our first flight.  You apply with this through an FAA website called IACRA.  Instructions are [on the FAA website](https://iacra.faa.gov/IACRA/HelpAndInfo.aspx?id=6). It's not the friendliest website, so filling it out together should make it a pretty simple process.

### FAA Medical Certificate:
As a student pilot, before you solo, you need a 3rd Class Medical Certificate.  It's a pretty easy process and is no more involved than a basic physical exam.  That said, if there are any complications in your medical history, they may take some time to resolve.  If you think you have anything concerning in your medical history, we should talk about it before you start filling out the FAA application, as there are some things that can complicate your medical issuance.  Booking a consultation with an Aviation Medical Examiner (AME) can help that process so that your medical issuance process is as smooth as it can be.

I use [Dr. Tom Faulkner](https://drtomfaulknerame.com/) for my medical.  His office is located just north of the Atlanta airport and he books appointments on his website.

[Dr. Alan Kozarsky](https://atlantaame.com/) is another good medical examiner, but his office and availability makes it more of a challenge than some others.

There are plenty of other AMEs in the Atlanta area.

### Private Pilot Knowledge Test:
Also called "the written exam."  There is a lot of foundational knowledge that you'll need to take the written exam.  This information is also tremendously helpful to know when we start talking about flying concepts.  A few of the online courses that are available to help study for the written exam are:
* [Gold Seal](https://groundschool.com/)
* [The Finer Points](https://www.learnthefinerpoints.com/ground-school)
* [Flight Insight](https://www.flight-insight.com/)
* [Sporty's](https://www.sportys.com/learn-to-fly-course-private-pilot-test-prep-online-app-and-tv.html)
* [King Schools](https://kingschools.com/private-pilot-certificate)
