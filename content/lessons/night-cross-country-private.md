### Night Flight Plan

#### Route of Flight
`KPDK AHN KCPP CVC POSEY KLOWD KPDK`

Distance: 151.4 NM

#### Discussion Items During Flight
1. Leg One (`KPDK - AHN`)
   - Tune VOR and Set OBS Before Takeoff
   - Plan a radial to avoid KLZU Airspace
   - Determine Altitude for Direction of VFR Flight
   - Track Radial Inbound
   - Pilotage at Night versus Day (different visual references)
   - VOR Zone of Confusion
2. Leg Two (`AHN - KCPP`)
   - Reset OBS, Track Outbound Course to KCPP
   - Discussion of "Darkness" and cockpit lighting, in-flight emergencies
   - Search for Airport Beacon
   - Pilot-Controlled Lighting (3-clicks, 5-clicks, 7-clicks)
     - Use 7 clicks to identify runway
     - Use 5 clicks to "turn down" lights for better visability in the pattern
3. Leg Three (`KCPP - CVC via I-20`)
   - Use of Roads at Night
     - Visual References
     - Emergency Landing Sight
   - Maintain Situational Awareness with Pilotage
   - Using enroute airports and CTAF to turn on runway lights enroute
4. Leg Four (`CVC - POSEY - KLOWD`)
   - Flying over Suburban Areas
     - Landing Sites
     - Hazards of Lasers
     - Obstacles (Stone Mountain)
   - Discussion of Airspace (Class B Shelves)
5. Leg Five (`Downtown Orbit, KPDK Return`)
   - Flying over Urban Areas
     - Altitude Planning (3,000' MSL)
     - Landing Sights
     - Hazards
     - Obstacles (Buildings, Towers)
       - Towers between Downtown and KPDK for 3L/3R
         - Risk of VFR Descent from Downtown to Runways on "Straight In" Path
   - PDK Night Operations
     - Night Curfew
     - Communications: CTAF versus Towered Operations
