The FAA publishes the PTS (Practical Test Standards), which are the basis for all practical exams.  The current version of this document is FAA-S-8081-9D.[^1] However, it's a fairly large document, spread across several sections, which makes it hard to see just the topics we need to cover for the add-on Instrument rating to the Flight Instructor rating.  To make life easier, and to make it easier to navigate to lesson plan summaries, I'm breaking out the requirements for the CFII Add-On Rating here.

| Area of Operation | Tasks | Description                                           |
| ----------------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| II                | **A** | **Instruments and Navigation Equipment**              |
|                   | C     | IFR Regulations and Publications                      |
| III               | B     | Cross-Country Flight Planning                         |
|                   | C     | Instrument Cockpit Check                              |
| V                 | A     | ATC Clearances                                        |
|                   | B     | IFR Departure, En Route, and Arrival Procedures       |
| VI                | A     | Straight-and-Level Flight                             |
|                   | B     | Turns                                                 |
|                   | C     | Airspeed Changes                                      |
|                   | D     | Constant Airspeed Climbs and Descents                 |
|                   | E     | Constant Rate Climbs and Descents                     |
|                   | F     | Timed Turns to Magnetic Headings                      |
|                   | G     | Steep Turns                                           |
|                   | **H** | **Unusual Attitudes**                                 |
| VII               | A     | Intercepting and Tracking Nav Systems & DME Arcs      |
|                   | B     | Holding Procedures                                    |
| VIII              | **A** | **Non-Precision Instrument Approach (Partial Panel)** |
|                   | **B** | **Precision Instrument Approach**                     |
|                   | C     | Missed Approach                                       |
|                   | D     | Circling Approach                                     |
|                   | E     | Landing from a Straight-In Approach                   |
| IX                | A     | Loss of Communications                                |
|                   | B     | Partial Panel Approach                                |
| X                 | A     | Postflight Procedures                                 |

The bold elements are required on the practical test, though you are expected to be able to perform all of the elements from the PTS for the CFII rating.  (I excluded the two multi-engine tasks from the PTS.)

Areas II - V are generally "on the ground," to be covered during the oral portion of the practical teset.

Areas VI - X are generally "in the air," though the DPE could elect to cover any of the elements at any point during the flight test.  Generally, I expect the flight portion of a CFII checkride will include:

* Airwork
  * Steep turns
  * Constant airspeed climbs and descents
  * Constant rate climbs and descents
  * Unusual Attitudes
* Approach Procedures
  * Partial-Panel Non-Precision Approach
  * Precision Approach
  * Missed Approach
  * Circling
  * Landing from an approach

You can generlaly get through the flight sequence pretty quickly, though you should ask the examiner to give you delay vectors if you need time to brief the approach or set up the avionics for the next approach.  They can talk faster than you can fly and program, so give yourself a minute to get set up.  It's far easier to do that than it is to fail the checkride because you didn't take the delay.



[^1]: This PTS version is current as of March, 2023. The FAA released the draft version of FAA-S-8081-9E, which will take effect during 2023, and makes some changes to the PTS requirements. I'll review those separately.
