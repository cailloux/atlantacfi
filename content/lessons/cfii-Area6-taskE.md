### Constant Rate Climbs and Descents

1. Exhibits instructional knowledge of constant rate climbs and descents by describing⎯
   1. procedure using full panel and partial panel for an entry into a constant rate climb or descent. 
   2. a stabilized constant rate straight climb or climbing turn, using the vertical speed indicator. 
   3. a level-off from a constant rate straight climb or climbing turn. 
   4. an entry into a constant rate straight descent or descending turn. 
   5. a stabilized constant rate straight descent or descending turn using the vertical speed indicator. 
   6. level-off from a constant rate straight descent or descending turn. 
2. Exhibits instructional knowledge of common errors related to constant rate climbs and descents by describing⎯
   1. failure to use a proper power setting and pitch attitude. 
   2. improper correction of vertical rate, airspeed, heading, or rate-of-turn errors. 
   3. uncoordinated use of controls. 
   4. improper trim control. 
3. Demonstrates and simultaneously explains a constant rate climb and a constant rate descent from an instructional standpoint. 
4. Analyzes and corrects simulated common errors related to constant rate climbs and descents.
