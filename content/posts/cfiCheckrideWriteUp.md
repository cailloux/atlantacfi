# CFI Checkride Write-Up

I'm writing this some time after the checkride, reconstructing it from memory and notes that I took shortly after the checkride.  I'm happy to answer any questions you have as you review this.

## Introduction

I initially scheduled my Commercial checkride with Randy for February 15, 2023, because he was scheduling months in advance, and that was the first date we found that worked for both of us.  Through some luck and someone else's cancellation, I rescheduled my Commercial checkride for November, 2022, so I converted my February 15 date to a full-day CFI checkride.

I'm glad it is over (and I passed, not to bury the lede), but I was out of town the week before the checkride, and that added to some of my stress.  If I were to have done it again, I would have pushed out my CFI checkride so that I was "home" for the two weeks prior, to let me practice the flying and teaching a bit more...

In creating the endorsements for the checkride, Alec Liberman had a one-page endorsement sheet that listed all required ground training (i.e. it was a separate, endorsed log of all elements required by ยง 61.185, in addition to the ground time in my logbook), and Randy commented really positively about this document.

## CFI Checkride

### Getting to the Checkride

The weather for the morning of the checkride in Atlanta looked iffy, but TAFs in the area (Athens, Anderson) were forecasting generally VFR conditions, with some concern for lower ceilings.  In fact, during the oral, half the field was MVFR and half was clear and blue skies.

Because of the weather, and on recommendation from a club instructor who previously had a checkride with Randy, I flew out to Elberton the night before, booked a night at the Samuel Elbert Hotel, and borrowed the crew car from the airport.  That meant that, instead of an early wakeup in Atlanta and worrying about the weather, while flying to the checkride in IFR, I had a relaxed evening flight out and a slower morning on the day of the checkride.  It probably would have gone well either way, but I eliminated a huge stress for the checkride.

### Paperwork

I got to the airport in Elberton about an hour early, and Randy had me set up in the room for the checkride.  It gave me a chance to pull out the aircraft logbooks, my lesson plans, training aids, and iPad for slides.

I laid out my logbook, written test results, AGI certificate (temp), Commercial certificate, medical, and test fee prior to the start of the checkride.  I had my Spin endorsement tabbed to that Randy could quickly find it.  For the FIA and FOI answer codes, I wrote on a PostIt note what the code and the "explanation" were, and Randy referenced those during the exam to make sure he asked about each area that I got wrong.  I debated using the evidence of my AGI as proof that I passed the FOI, but decided that I didn't want to deviate from the "script" too much.  With everything in order, and my walled a little bit lighter, we did the back-and-forth with IACRA and began the oral exam.

### Oral Exam

#### Fundamentals of Instruction

If you want an outline of the oral exam, grab the CFI PTS and go element-by-element through the document.  We went through all areas during the course of the oral exam.  I'm pretty sure the oral exam will take about 4 hours, regardless of how long or short any specific answer is.  Randy continued to bring up topics to discuss, from within the PTS, as the time went on.

We began with his favorite question, "what is learning?"  I joked that I'd give him the FAA answer, and he replied that it would be helpful since it was an FAA checkride.  That opened up a fairly exhaustive conversation through all topics within the fundamentals of instruction.  We have pretty detailed gouge on everything that was asked previously, and those write-ups are on point for what we covered.

One item that Randy asked about, which I hadn't seen discussed previously, was the five hazardous attitudes, what the antidotes were, and a discussion of how those might manifest during flight training.  I recalled four of them, and knew I was missing the fifth, so I took a quick look at my reference material to find the 5th (I had a slip and recalled macho, but was thinking invulnerability).  We had a bit of a discussion about how those attitudes might manifest during actual instruction, and how to best deal with those attitudes in students.  Randy told me a story of someone who was so convinced in their ability to perform power-on stalls "correctly" during a checkride that he let the applicant put them into a two rotation spin before Randy recovered and ended the practical exam.  Again -- the more you can get Randy to talk, the less you have to talk.  Assuming it's going "to plan," the oral will clock in at about 4 hours, and if you can get him to fill some of that time, the less you have to talk.

We took several breaks during the oral, both because I wanted to get some coffee and water, and because Randy was dealing with an FAA issue in his role as airport manager.  He told me up front and apologized for the times he needed to step away.

As we continued through the FOI, Randy asked me for the elements of a lesson plan.  I should have done a better job on this one and said, "here's my template for a lesson plan," which was in my CFI folder.  I forgot I had this document and pulled up a finished one instead, but it would have been easier to work from my template.

I mention this because, in my preparation (and other CFI candidates, from my conversations), most folks go in hard on Task A and B when studying, in addition to the required Task E.  The others don't get a ton of focus, and it's all fair game.  The important thing is to remember that you've prepared all the material in your *CFI Binder* (whether physical or virtual), so take the opportunity to reference it.  Can you look up Maslow's Hierarchy?  That might not be wise.  But if asked to discuss the elements of a lesson plan, it is probably easier to pull it out and walk Randy through it.

For the required Task E (Instructor Professionalism and Responsibilities), I had a slide deck prepared and ready to go, and Randy was happy to let me present that.  At the end, I summarized the content and asked if Randy had any questions; he did not.

#### Technical Subject Areas

Randy has two go-to questions.  The first was in the FOIs, and the second is here: "what makes an airplane fly?"

We dove into the Technical Subject areas, and sampled much of the content.  For Runway Incursions, I had a slide deck ready to go that covered the 17 elements required, and Randy had no questions when it was done.  I opened with a video about how quickly and easily a runway incursion can develop, and joked with Randy that he may have seen it a time or two before.  He smiled and agreed that he probably had.  He understands the game we play with this checkride, that we're here to tell him about a variety of topics, in which he may have substantially greater knowledge than we do.  I emphasize here that Randy *wants* you to succeed with this (or any other) checkride, so don't give him a reason to fail you.

We also went through Task M, Logbook Entries and Endorsements, and we didn't go incredibly deeply here as I talked through what was required for a student, showed him my template for record keeping of student records, and discussed the **LEGAL** significance of logbook entries.

With Randy's question, "what makes an airplane fly," I spent time talking about the Principles of Flight, which also got us into discussing airplane flight controls.  We ended up circling around back to aerodynamics again at the end of the oral, when Randy asked what the aerodynamic difference was between a forward slip and a sideslip.  My brain short circuited and I *waaay* overthought what he was asking for on this one.  I asked to take a quick break, and did a quick summary of these two types of slips on the whiteboard.  I reviewed that forward slips are to present a large surface area to the relative wind to increase descent rates; side-slips are to align the longitudinal axis of the airplane with the runway during crosswind conditions.  That, along with my model airplane showing approaches to the runway, was all that was needed.  My brain was elsewhere when he asked that question...

#### Preflight Preparation

We went through nearly everything here besides weather.  It was at this point that Randy had me teach him how our airplane was airworthy.  We went through 91.205, AROW, airworthiness directives, and KOEL for types of flight.  I knew the airplane and engine logbooks well, and we also took the compliance report out and talked about the types of inspections and the applicable airworthiness directives.  I scoured the logbooks a few days before the checkride with another CFI candidate (who also passed his checkride!), and we identified several discrepancies that needed to be corrected, and some missing logbook entries that would raise eyebrows during the checkride if they weren't completed.  None of it was a big deal, but knowing what to look for, and where, in the airframe and engine logs was a huge benefit.

We also reviewed a bit on certificates and and the requirements and process for issuing them.  We talked about Flight Reviews, IACRA, and medicals.  Nothing was particularly remarkable during this conversation.  It was mainly a recitation of facts, much of which we covered when we discussed logbook endorsements and required logbook entries for student pilots.

#### Maneuver Lesson

Randy had me prepare a lesson on Stalls and Spins.  In preparing the lesson, I went through Section XI, Task B, C, and G, to build out the lesson plan.  I also had a presentation that walked through the ground/knowledge elements for the stalls.  There are great images online from the Airplane Flying Handbook/Pilots Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge, and I used those in my presentation.  When it got to spins, I talked about the knowledge elements with an emphasis on likely spin scenarios and the importance of spin avoidance.  Additionally, I reviewed the spin recovery procedure (PARE) in the event of a spin.  At the end of the lesson presentation, I asked if Randy had any questions.  He had none.  Randy also reviewed the lesson plan I had for stalls and spins, and was satisfied with the lesson.

#### After the Oral

It was a VERY long morning.  We went from 10AM - 2PM, with some breaks for water/coffee, and for Randy to field some phone calls with the FAA about one of his instrument approaches.  When we were done, I borrowed the crew car and got some lunch.  Randy repeatedly emphasized that the day was mine, and I shouldn't rush myself.  After the morning session, getting in the plane to talk for another 90 minutes of the checkride was not my most favorite day of flying ever.  **Bring snacks.  Take breaks.  You'll need it.**  This checkride is a marathon, not a sprint.  It's a 4-hour oral exam.

### Flight

#### Preflight and Start-Up

**Make sure to put the aircraft documents back in the plane before the flight portion.**  I put them back during one of my morning breaks, and verified they were there with my checklist, but it is something that can be really easy to overlook.

Randy had me preflight the airplane, like I normally would, and vocalize everything as I went through the process.  He didn't ask too many questions, as I was explaining most of what I was doing or what I was checking as I went around the airplane.  He asked what water would look like, if it was in the fuel, and what the belt was at the front of the engine cowling (alternator belt).

We got in and I did a briefing for him, explaining that he should call out anything he sees that he doesn't like, but I'll assume I'm PIC for the checkride, and I want to do 3-way exchange of controls.  I asked if he was familiar with the doors and seatbelts (yes, he was), and asked if he wanted me to start the airplane, or if he would.  He asked me to start it up and talk through what I was doing as we went.  So I narrated the checklist and startup procedure, we each checked our breaks, and then I taxied out to the runway.

#### Takeoff

Randy said he would perform a soft field takeoff and I would critique him.  As we were getting ready to go, another airplane was coming in on a practice instrument approach.  I told Randy I didn't quite know where he was, or what the missed approach procedure was like, so I was going to wait on that aircraft to complete the approach.  Randy had a solid sense of where they were, and said that they wouldn't be an issue for the takeoff, so off we went.  He did a good job of the takeoff, so my critique was a confirmation of the elements of a soft-field takeoff (correct procedures, liftoff at slowest possible airspeed, acceleration in ground effect, climb away, retract flaps, establish Vy).  He gave me back controls and asked what some of the common errors were.  His quizzing about common errors was a theme for all the maneuvers.

#### Maneuvers

We flew away from the airport and we performed some clearing turns.  I had my pre-maneuver checklist and referenced it as we began the maneuver sequence.  We started with Commercial steep turns to the left and the right, and my altitude got a little bit off on these.  He asked about common errors, and I quickly confessed, "well, you saw one of them right there, with failing to maintain altitude."  I was within standards on the maneuver, but my left turn was a little bit worse than the right.

We then went into a Chandelle (left only), and it was also to standards.  From there, he had me do an accelerated stall demo, and then he performed a power-off stall, with my critiquing him.  He went quickly through the maneuver, and he also did a great job of this one.  I joked that he may have had a flight lesson or two before as he was smooth on the controls.  For all of these maneuvers, he had me describe the common errors.

We then shifted to ground reference maneuvers, first performing 8's on Pylons.  We found a couple islands in Lake Hartwell, and I went through and did a good job while narrating the entire time.  After that, I performed a turn around a point.  He asked what was similar and what was different between the two maneuvers, and I discussed that as we went back towards the airport.

During each of these maneuvers, I commented that I was looking for a field or other safe place to land if the engine were to have issues, given we were so close to the ground.  Randy joked, "do you think something might happen to the engine?"  I replied that I read a statistic that checkrides have a near 100% engine failure rate.  Sure enough, a short time later, Randy commented that the engine was starting to run a little bit rough, so I began my flow and followed it up with the checklist.  Given that we hadn't lost power yet, I explained that we were still heading back to the airport, but I was looking for suitable landing sites.  As we went along, he continued to reduce power, and it got to the point where I explained the prudent thing to do would be to declare an emergency and make a precautionary landing on a nearby field.  At that point, the engine failed, and I ran the ABCDE memory aid for an engine failure, following it up with the engine failure checklist.  I identified the field I was aiming for, the wind direction, and my planned approach.  We ended up in a decent position to make the landing, and I started to slip to get it down at the beginning of the field.  He was satisfied at that point and had me go around.

#### Landings

We returned to EBA and I discussed traffic pattern entry.  I explained the FAA has good guidance in an Advisory Circular on this, and that my preferred approach is to enter at pattern altitude in the crosswind, because I can see the airport and look for other traffic at the same altitude in the pattern.  He asked about other techniques, and I explained that I don't love crossing 500' above pattern altitude, as that puts me at the same altitude as jets who are in the pattern, and it's hard to see other traffic when you're looking down at them.

Randy had me perform a short field landing.  I declared the start of the 1000' markers as my touchdown point, and then narrated my landing.  "High or low?  Fast or slow?"  I explained that a short field landing is better performed by extending the downwind slightly to give more time to adjust the final approach to hit the touchdown point.  I discussed each configuration change as I made the landing and simulated max breaking.  We continued rolling and he told me to take off again and perform a soft field landing.

On the soft field landing, I again narrated my approach and came in.  The approach was decent, the roundout was good, but I bounced the touchdown...  Rough.  I *could* have saved it, but I decided if I were with a student, I would really do a go around in that situation, so full throttle, accelerate, slowly retract flaps, and around for another lap in the pattern.  Randy and I discussed it, and agreed that it was easily salvageable, but the importance is to teach students to go around if something is wrong, versus trying to "save it."  He also explained that he'll never bust someone for a go around if they feel that's the right course of action (other than the Power Off 180).  My second landing, narrating again, gentle touchdown, full yoke back, rollout, and taxi in to parking.  He congratulated me on my successful checkride.
