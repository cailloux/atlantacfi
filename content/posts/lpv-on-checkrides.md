### LPV and LNAV/VNAV Approaches on the Instrument and CFII Checkrides

Yes, you can use a suitable Approach with Vertical Guidance (APV) approach in place of another precision approach, like an ILS, on your checkride, if the Decision Altitude is less than 300' AGL.  That means the RNAV/GPS approach to your local airfield can count as precision for the purposes of the checkride.

From the Instrument Rating ACS:
> A localizer performance with vertical guidance (LPV) approach with a decision altitude (DA) greater than 300 feet height above terrain (HAT) may be used as a nonprecision approach; however,due to the precision of its glidepath and localizer-like lateral navigation characteristics, an LPV can be used to demonstrate precision approach proficiency (AOA VI Task B) if the DA is equal to or less than 300 feet HAT. 

And from the CFII PTS: 
> An LPV approach is technically a nonprecision approach, however, due to the precision of its glidepath and localizer-like lateral navigation characteristics, an LPV can be used to demonstrate precision approach proficiency (AOA VIII TASK B). Also, although LPV and LNAV/VNAV approaches are nonprecision approaches, they cannot be used to demonstrate nonprecision approach proficiency (AOA VIII TASK A) due to the presence of a glidepath.

So what is an APV, and why is it almost like a precision approach?

#### APV Approaches, as a Category

The FAA created a newer category of approaches that are neither Precision nor Non-Precision approaches, called "Approaches with Vertical Guidance," abbreviated APV.  These approaches provide both horizontal course guidance and vertical glidepath guidance.  They tend to rival the accuracy of an ILS, but don't meet every standard of performance to be classified as a precision approach.

The underlying standards are governed by the International Civil Aviation Organization.

APV approaches require a high degree of accuracy to be flown and offer terrain and obstacle clearance similar to that found on an ILS, but 

If you dig deep into ICAO Annex 10, Volume 1, Chapter 3, Section 7, and go all the way to the end, you'll see the various definitions of approaches and the accuracy requirements for RNAV/GPS-based approaches.

There is a small increase in accuracy required for a WAAS RNAV/GPS (a Space-Based Augmentation System) to go from APV to Category I Precision Approach.  The FAA has defined their own accuracy standards, which are similar to ICAO, but aren't the same.  The discrepancy, in Time To Alert, from 6.2 seconds, to 6.0 seconds, is enough to make our APV approaches ineligible for consideration as a Precision Approach.  (LPV-200 indicates an LPV approach with a decision altitude that is 200' AGL.)

So APV approaches are approaches that provide accurate horizontal and vertical guidance.  



### A Note About "+V"

Some panel mounted GPS navigators provide an "Advisory Glidepath" and annunciate the availability of the glidepath with a "+V" indication on the display, when inbound to the Final Approach Fix.  This indicates that an advisory glidepath is available, but this glidepath hasn't been reviewed for TERPS guidance and only provides a straight-line vertical guidance from the FAF to the MAP.  It's possible that you can descent below a step-down fix on "+V" guidance, though I haven't seen a case yet where that would occur in any way but the theoretical
