I recently came across the approach plate for the [RNAV 4 at (ALM) Alamagordo, NM](/documents/KALM-RNAV-04.pdf).

It's a more-or-less standard instrument approach in the mountains, with higher altitudes to keep pilots away from terrain in the east.  It has a hold-in-lieu-of-procedure-turn for procedure entry when you're not receiving vectors (and a straight-in approach clearance).

With proximity to a nearby Air Force base (HMN), the military controllers provide approach and departure services to traffic at the nearby civilian airfield.  When the HMN tower is closed, services are provided by Albuquerque Center.  Overall, then, this seems to be a normal state of affairs.  The Gulf Coast of Florida and Alabama have a similar setup, with numerous military and civilian airports.

What makes ALM special?  Look at the Initial/Intermediate Fix on this approach.  It's located **in** R-5107D, which exists from the surface to 22,000 feet.  You'll receive vectors into the restricted airspace to begin the approach, or you'll be cleared to navigate yourself into R-5107D to establish yourself inbound.  Go missed?  The published procedure finds you re-entering and holding within the restricted airspace.

I suspect this airspace exists to support the missile testing at White Sands, and wouldn't be authorized while high-speed projectiles are operating in the region.  They're hazardous to general aviation.  Nearby Route 70, and White Sands National Park, are both closed while missile testing is taking place.

After being taught to steer clear of restricted airspace, here's a case of needing fly through it to make it to Alamagordo.  It's worth the visit to see the [International Space Hall of Fame](https://www.spacehalloffame.org/).  There is an extensive rocketry display from the heyday of NASA, as well as Apollo memorabilia and a wall of inductees to the Hall of Fame, itself.
